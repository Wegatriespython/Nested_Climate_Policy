# Demonstrating the Equivalence and Efficiency of the Nested Model Compared to a Single GE Model

## Introduction

This document demonstrates that:
1. The nested model is an equivalent and efficient alternative to a single n-period GE model with embedded climate policy
2. Solving the entire problem within a single GE model is computationally infeasible

## Overview of the Two Approaches

### 1. Nested Model (Current Approach)
- **Outer Loop:** Policy maker uses MCTS to optimize climate policy over n periods
- **Inner Loop:** Two-period GE model solves for equilibrium at each node
- **State Transitions:** States update based on GE outcomes, damages, and learning

### 2. Single GE Model with Embedded Climate Policy
- **Objective Function:** Incorporates policy maker's objective directly over n periods
- **Agents and Firms:** Optimize over entire n-period horizon with endogenous policy
- **Equilibrium Concept:** DSGE model with embedded policy maker optimization

## Theoretical Equivalence

### Dynamic Programming Framework
Both approaches solve:

\[
\max_{\{ a_t \}} \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{n} \beta^t \left( u(S_t) - D(E_t, \theta_t) Y_t \right) \right]
\]

subject to:
\[
S_{t+1} = f(S_t, a_t, \epsilon_t)
\]

Both models satisfy the Bellman equation, ensuring theoretical equivalence.

## Computational Efficiency Analysis

### Dimensionality Comparison

#### Nested Model
- **State Space:** Managed efficiently by MCTS
- **Action Space:** Explored selectively through MCTS
- **Computation:** Solves smaller problems sequentially

#### Single GE Model
- **State Space:** All variables over n periods
- **Action Space:** Combined space of all controls
- **Computation:** Must solve everything simultaneously

### Mathematical Complexity

Let:
- m: Economic variables per period
- k: Number of agents
- a: Actions per agent per period

Single GE model complexity:
\[
\text{Total Variables} = n \times (k \times m + \text{Policy Variables})
\]
\[
\text{Computational Complexity} = O(a^{k n})
\]

## Demonstrating Unsolvability of Single GE Model

### Theoretical Barriers

1. **Fixed-Point Problems**
   - High-dimensional space proportional to n
   - Nonlinear dynamics make finding contractions difficult

2. **Expectations Formation**
   - Agents must form expectations over entire horizon
   - Interdependent optimization problems due to endogenous policy

3. **Computational Limits**
   - Bellman's curse of dimensionality
   - Nonlinear equation systems grow exponentially

### Single GE Model Formulation

Attempts to solve:
\[
\max_{\{ C_t, L_t, I_t, K_t^i, \theta_t^i, \tau_t \}_{t=0}^n} \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{n} \beta^t \left( \frac{ C_t^{1 - \sigma} }{1 - \sigma} - \chi \frac{ L_t^{1 + \nu} }{1 + \nu} - D(E_t, \theta_t) Y_t \right) \right]
\]

Subject to:
- Economic constraints
- Policy constraints
- Expectations formation
- Market clearing conditions

### Key Infeasibility Factors

1. **High Dimensionality**
   - Variables and constraints grow exponentially with n
   - Non-convexities from technology choices and adjustment costs

2. **Interdependencies**
   - Agents' expectations depend on future policy
   - Policy depends on agents' behavior

3. **Computational Resources**
   - Memory and processing requirements exceed practical limits
   - No known algorithms for efficient solution

## Advantages of Nested Model

1. **Problem Decomposition**
   - Separates policy optimization from equilibrium computation
   - Maintains theoretical optimality through Bellman equation

2. **Computational Efficiency**
   - MCTS scales logarithmically with simulations
   - Parallel processing possible
   - Results can be cached and reused

## Conclusion

The nested model:
- Is theoretically equivalent to the single GE model
- Provides the only computationally feasible solution approach
- Maintains optimality while managing complexity

The single GE model is demonstrably unsolvable due to:
- Computational complexity
- High-dimensional state space
- Interdependent expectations
