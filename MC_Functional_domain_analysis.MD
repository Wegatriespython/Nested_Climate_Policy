# Computational Domain Analysis for Economic Models

## Core Concept
Using Monte Carlo methods to analyze:
1. Direct function landscape (objective + constraints) without optimization
2. Optimization feasibility regions through solution attempts
3. Comparative analysis between (1) and (2) to understand optimization behavior

## Analysis Types

### Function Landscape Analysis
- Map topology of objective function surface
- Identify local minima/maxima, saddle points
- Analyze constraint boundary geometry
- Measure surface "roughness" and gradients
- Detect problematic features (steep valleys, flat regions)

### Optimization-Based Analysis
- Success/failure mapping of optimization attempts
- Solution characteristics in feasible regions
- Boundary detection between feasible/infeasible regions
- Numerical stability analysis

### Geometric Properties Testing
1. **Convexity**
   - Midpoint sampling between feasible points
   - Constraint boundary shape analysis
   - Local vs global convexity regions

2. **Smoothness**
   - Gradient discontinuities
   - Constraint intersection geometry
   - Boundary regularity measures

3. **Dimensionality**
   - Manifold dimension estimation
   - Parameter dependency structure
   - Effective degrees of freedom

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Sampling Strategy
1. Grid-based for low dimensions
2. Latin Hypercube for high dimensions
3. Adaptive sampling near interesting features
4. Boundary-focused sampling

### Key Metrics
1. **Function Landscape**
   - Gradient magnitudes/directions
   - Hessian eigenvalues
   - Local curvature measures
   - Constraint intersection angles

2. **Optimization Behavior**
   - Solution density
   - Convergence rates
   - Error types/frequencies
   - Parameter sensitivity measures

### Visualization Requirements
1. Low-dimensional projections
2. Level sets/contours
3. Gradient fields
4. Boundary maps
5. Success/failure heat maps

## Computational Considerations
- Parallel evaluation strategies
- Efficient storage of high-dimensional results
- Adaptive resolution in regions of interest
- Numerical stability in gradient calculations

## Next Steps
1. Implement direct function evaluation framework
2. Develop geometric property test suite
3. Create comparative analysis tools
4. Build visualization pipeline
5. Test on simple known models first

## Open Questions
