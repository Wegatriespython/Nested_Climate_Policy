# Monte Carlo Tree Search for Climate-Economy Models
## A Novel Nested Computational Architecture

---

## Motivation

### Current Challenges in Climate-Economy Modeling
1. **Computational Complexity**
   - Joint optimization of policy and economic equilibrium
   - Computational burden of forward-looking expectations
   - Trade-off between model detail and solution feasibility

2. **Policy Analysis Limitations**
   - Rigid policy paths
   - Limited treatment of credibility
   - Simplified expectations formation
   - Static technology assumptions

### Why This Approach?
- Separates policy search from equilibrium computation
- Handles policy credibility explicitly
- Incorporates stochastic technology-emissions relationships
- Allows for adaptive expectations

## Core Architecture

### Nested Structure
1. **Outer Loop: Policy Search**
   - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework
   - Dynamic policy path exploration
   - Handles uncertainty in policy effectiveness
   - Adapts to changing conditions

2. **Inner Loop: Economic Equilibrium**
   - Period-by-period equilibrium computation
   - Technology and skill factor dynamics
   - Policy expectation formation
   - Stochastic productivity shocks
