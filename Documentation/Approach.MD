### Climate Policy as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)

This implementation models climate policy sequencing as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, where policy decisions affect both economic welfare and environmental outcomes through state transitions.

#### 1. MDP Framework

The problem is structured with the following components:

- **State Space (S)**: Each state s ∈ S is characterized by:
  - Emissions (E)
  - Welfare (W)
  - Additional state variables tracking economic indicators

- **Action Space (A)**: Policy combinations along two dimensions:
  - Carbon Tax Level: {Low, High}
  - Revenue Distribution: {Welfare Transfers, Green Subsidies}
  
- **Transition Function**: P(s' | s, a)
  - Deterministic transitions based on economic production functions
  - State evolution depends on current state and chosen policy action

- **Reward Function**: R(s, a)
  - Utility = W - ψE
  - Balances welfare (W) and emissions (E)
  - ψ represents the relative weight on emissions

#### 2. Economic Production Framework

The economy consists of two sectors

##### Black (Carbon-Intensive) Sector:
- Production function: Q_B = A_B * L_B^α_B
- Effective cost: c_eff_B = w_B + c_t * ε/A_B
- Labor demand: L_B = ((P_B * A_B * α_B)/c_eff_B)^(1/(1-α_B))
- Emissions: E = ε * Q_B
- Profits: π_B = P_B * Q_B - w_B * L_B - c_t * E

##### Green Sector:
- Production function: Q_G = A_G * L_G^α_G
- Effective productivity: A_G_eff = A_G + λT (with subsidies)
- Labor demand: L_G = ((P_G * A_G_eff * α_G)/w_G)^(1/(1-α_G))
- Profits: π_G = P_G * Q_G - w_G * L_G

#### 3. Policy Mechanisms

##### Carbon Tax:
- Revenue generation: T = c_t * E
- Impact on black sector through effective cost
- Two levels: {0, c_tax}

##### Revenue Distribution:
1. Welfare Transfers:
   - Direct transfers to affected workers: W_BW = ωT
   - Worker utility: U_BW = w_B * L_B + W_BW

2. Green Subsidies:
   - Productivity enhancement: ΔA_G = λT
   - No direct transfers: W_BW = 0

#### 4. Aggregate Welfare Calculation

Total welfare is the sum of:
- Black sector worker utility (U_BW)
- Green sector worker utility (U_GW)
- Black firm profits (π_B)
- Green firm profits (π_G)

W_t = U_BW + U_GW + π_B + π_G

#### 5. Solution Approach

The implementation uses:
1. Forward state space enumeration
2. Path tracking through state nodes
3. Utility evaluation for complete paths
4. Ranking based on:
   - Primary: Total utility
   - Secondary: Cumulative emissions

This approach allows for:
- Complete policy sequence evaluation
- Identification of Pareto-efficient paths
- Analysis of welfare-emissions tradeoffs
- Understanding of sectoral transitions

The model captures key economic mechanisms while maintaining tractability, enabling analysis of policy sequencing effects on both environmental and economic outcomes.
