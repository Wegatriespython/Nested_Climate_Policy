# A Novel Computational Architecture for Climate-Economy Models
## Separating Policy Optimization and Economic Equilibrium

---

## Motivation

### Current Challenges in Climate-Economy Modeling
1. **Computational Complexity**
   - Joint optimization of policy and economic equilibrium
   - Curse of dimensionality with increased model sophistication
   - Trade-off between economic detail and policy optimization

2. **Modeling Limitations**
   - Perfect foresight assumptions
   - Limited handling of uncertainty
   - Static technology-emissions relationships
   - Simplified damage functions

### Why Now?
- Computational advances (MCTS, parallel computing)
- Growing need for dynamic policy analysis
- Increased focus on technology transitions
- Better understanding of policy credibility effects

## Core Innovation: Computational Separation

### Architecture
1. **Outer Loop: Policy Optimization**
   - Monte Carlo Tree Search for policy decisions
   - Handles uncertainty and learning
   - No perfect foresight requirement
   - Adaptive damage estimation

2. **Inner Loop: Economic Model**
   - General equilibrium with technology choice
   - Joint distribution of productivity and emissions
   - Skill-based adjustment costs
   - Forward-looking expectations
